# Homicide-analysis

This data analysis project utilizes the "homicide_by_countries" dataset to extract insightful columns and employs visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to represent the findings visually.

## Process Overview
### Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
The dataset is loaded using Pandas to understand its structure.
Initial exploration includes checking for missing values and data types.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Data cleaning involves converting data types for better analysis.
Columns like 'Rate', 'Count', and 'Year' are converted to appropriate data types.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA includes analyzing the top locations with the highest count of homicides.
Visualizations like pie charts, bar plots, and line plots are used to represent the data.

### Insights Generation:
Insights are derived by grouping data based on regions, subregions, and years.
Summarized counts are visualized through bar plots and treemaps for better understanding.
